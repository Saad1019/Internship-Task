Data Science & Analytics Internship Tasks
Overview
This repository contains my completed tasks for the Data Science & Analytics Internship at DevelopersHub Corporation, due August 2, 2025. The tasks demonstrate skills in data exploration, visualization, and machine learning using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

Objective: Understand and visualize the Iris Dataset to analyze relationships, distributions, and outliers.
Approach:
Loaded the dataset using seaborn.load_dataset('iris').
Summarized the dataset structure using pandas methods (shape, columns, head).
Created visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib:
Scatter plot of petal length vs. petal width, colored by species.
Histograms of all numerical features.
Box plots to show spread and outliers.
Bonus pair plot for comprehensive relationships.




Results and Insights:
Petal length and width are strongly correlated, with clear species separation (setosa has smaller petals, virginica larger).
Sepal width has a few outliers; other features are tightly clustered.
Petal measurements are more effective than sepal measurements for distinguishing species.

Future Tasks
This repository will be updated with additional tasks (e.g., Customer Churn Prediction, Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction) as they are completed.
