# Data Science & Analytics Internship Tasks

**Company:** DevelopersHub Corporation  
**Deadline:** August 2, 2025  

This repository contains my completed tasks for the **Data Science & Analytics Internship**. Each task demonstrates my proficiency in data exploration, visualization, and machine learning using Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## 📌 Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

### 🎯 Objective
Understand and visualize the Iris Dataset to analyze relationships, distributions, and outliers.

### 🧠 Approach
- Loaded the dataset using `seaborn.load_dataset('iris')`.
- Summarized the dataset structure using pandas (`.shape`, `.columns`, `.head()`).
- Created visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib:
  - Scatter plot of **petal length vs. petal width**, colored by species.
  - **Histograms** of all numerical features.
  - **Box plots** to visualize spread and outliers.
  - Bonus: **Pair plot** to explore comprehensive feature relationships.

### 📊 Results & Insights
- **Petal length and width are strongly correlated**, showing clear species separation (Setosa has smaller petals, Virginica larger).
- **Sepal width contains a few outliers**; other features are tightly clustered.
- **Petal measurements are more effective** than sepal measurements for distinguishing species.
